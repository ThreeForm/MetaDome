# MetaDome
MetaDome 10-20 electrode placement data

The MetaDome is the foundational dataset that defines the elecrode location used for Ultracortex. It is a collection of cranium 3D scans which are processed in a consistent way. A parametric division of each head was created based on anatomical landamarks as defined in the 10-20 system, then these locations were averaged together to create a generic set of electrode locations. The node locations are useful for design of generic EEG headsets.

The current collection uses 8 subjects of diverse cranial shapes in an attempt to accomodate the largest number of people possible. The final Ultracortex design also uses springs, adjustment screws, and multiple sizes for fine tuning.
